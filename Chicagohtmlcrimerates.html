        <h1>Crime Rate Per Zone</h1>
        <p>According to data from the Chicago Police Department, 2025 has seen a marked reduction in violent crime city-wide. Through mid-year, homicides and shootings have dropped by over 30% compared to 2024, and robberies, carjackings, aggravated assaults and other serious offenses have also declined significantly. For many neighborhoods, this marks the lowest level of violence in decades.
That said — crime is not evenly distributed at the street level. Public data is aggregated by neighborhood, district, or community area, so “per-block” trends can vary widely depending on exact location, time, and types of crime.
What this means for residents: while overall statistics point toward improved safety, always approach local safety assessments with context. A “safe neighborhood” overall might still contain a few high-incident blocks — and vice versa.
We encourage communities, city planners, and interested residents to use quantitative data — and qualitative local knowledge — when evaluating neighborhood safety.</p>

        <h4> Takeaways</h4>
        <p>  As seen by the graph we are able to see the zones that have been experience higher number of crimes such as Near Sorth Side, Near South Side and South Shore, compared to the areas with the least number of crimes which would be Burnside, Florest Glen and Fuller park. </p>

        <h2>Type of crime per zone</h2>
        <p>Chicago crime landscape varies widely block by block.
Violent offenses such as robbery, aggravated assault, and occasional shootings cluster in specific “hot zones,” while property crimes like burglary, theft, and vehicle theft are more evenly spread throughout the city. Many neighborhoods considered low-risk for violent incidents still experience elevated rates of theft and auto-related crimes, especially near transit hubs, commercial corridors, and dense residential areas. Understanding these differences helps clarify that “safety” can look different from one block to the next.</p>
