<h2>Patterns Within Our Data</h2>
                <p> When we compared crime levels and graduation rates across Chicago’s community areas, a few clear patterns showed up. Some places, like Edison Park (9) and Norwood Park (10), had high graduation rates and relatively low crime, making them stand out as strong overall performers. On the other hand, areas such as Austin (25) and West Garfield Park (26) showed the opposite pattern, with higher crime paired with much lower graduation outcomes. We also found interesting mixed cases, like South Shore (43) and Woodlawn (42), where crime is fairly high but graduation rates are higher than expected, showing that academic achievement doesn’t always follow crime trends. These variations helped us see how different neighborhoods can have totally different combinations of safety and educational outcomes. </p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p> While every family needs vary, one thing is clear everyone wants their kids to be safe, without having to compromise their education. Thats why we compared how both factors were related to be able to find the best suited area so no family has to compromise anything. Due to their high reading levels, garduation rates and relatively low crime North Center, Morgan Park and Riverdale are ideal for upcoming families. </p>
